# Welcome

This is not intended to be a proper blog or a place where you can find high technical posts or guides about software development best practices. Please think of it more like a diary of my journey into programming, or better like a space for random thoughts that come to my mind during this journey. I hope you can find something useful or at least enjoy the reading at least as much as I enjoyed writing. :D
